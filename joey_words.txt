All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang...
Whadja think?
C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
Who's Rick?
I couldn't do it.
When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! "I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!"
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!
I'm his
I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
Thank you!
Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
Me? Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is lost.
Well, I'm- I'm showering.
Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
Nope.
I got fired.
Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
My mom will. Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
Hard to tell, I was naked.
Yeah? That's so nice!

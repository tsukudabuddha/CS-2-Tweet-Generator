years or so then you can you can just throw most of our assumptions you know right in the trash he throws the notepad in the waste bin So so what I am saying is is is that he picks the notepad back

that not what you want Joey Hey I need to talk to Charlie Is she there I meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker It could be better He uhm he fell asleep Barbados What am I

testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating Finally factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered Gigantosaurus Argentinasaurus And that just the herbivores I not even gonna discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development But all kidding aside in much the same way that
